Jenkins Automated Build and Test Setup with Git Flow
This repository contains the setup and configuration for automating the build and testing process using Jenkins and the Git Flow branching model. Follow the steps below to set up and use this automation in your development workflow.

Prerequisites
GitHub account
Git installed on the Jenkins server
Jenkins installed and configured
Prepare GitHub Repository
Create or Select Repository:
Create a new GitHub repository or select an existing one for your project.
Initialize Repository:
Initialize the repository with a README.md.
Ensure the repository contains at least two branches:
develop for ongoing development.
master (or main) for stable releases.
Apply Git Flow Model:
Install Git Flow tools if not already installed.
Initialize Git Flow in your repository with default branch names.
Add Jenkinsfile:
Add a Jenkinsfile to your repository in the root directory. Start with a simple pipeline.
Configure Jenkins
Install Plugins:
Install necessary plugins in Jenkins, such as Git and Pipeline.
Connect to GitHub:
Go to "Manage Jenkins" > "Manage Plugins" > "Available" and install "GitHub Integration Plugin".
Set up credentials in Jenkins for GitHub (username and token).
Create Pipeline Job:
Select "New Item", name your pipeline (e.g., "GitHub Pipeline"), and choose "Pipeline" as the type.
In the pipeline configuration, select "Pipeline script from SCM" and choose "Git" as the SCM.
Enter the repository URL and credentials.
Specify the branch to build (e.g., */develop).
Implement Webhooks for Continuous Integration
GitHub Webhook Setup:
In GitHub, go to your repository settings and select "Webhooks".
Add a new webhook with the following settings:
Payload URL: http://<your-jenkins-url>/github-webhook/
Content type: application/json
Select "Just the push event".
Ensure the webhook is active.
Trigger Builds:
With the webhook, Jenkins will trigger a new build every time changes are pushed to the connected branch.
Testing and Validation
Push Changes:
Push a change to the develop branch of your GitHub repository.
Verify Jenkins Build:
Verify that Jenkins automatically triggers a build and processes according to the steps defined in the Jenkinsfile.
Check the output in Jenkins to ensure the build and test stages are executed successfully.
